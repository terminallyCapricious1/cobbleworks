 bardonia.1.t:0 "The Bardonian Civil War"
 bardonia.1.d:0 "During the Ferrymen war just some time ago, the previously thought unstoppable army of Bardonia was defeated by the armies of Charon, otherwise known as the Ferrymen. In this war the chancellor of Bardonia, Uni, was chased down and killed by enemy soldiers during the Second Battle of Istanboulder, which quite immediately threw the higher Bardonian Government into peril. With different factions vying for power, an individual known as Jacw would eventually assume power over Bardonia. Jacw’s tenure was short-lived however, as a series of perhaps half-hearted and short-sighted decisions eventually worsened the state of the Empire, causing his removal.\n\nThe next to assume the Bardonian throne was Mobius, another prominent Bardonian official. Though he was able to cling to power during this tumultuous period, his power is not yet secured, he is threatened from the east by the architect of Bardonia, Crezyman. Crezyman is the builder of New Dorasterrock, the capital of Bardonia; this role has granted him significant sway in internal politics throughout Bardonia’s history. In this instance, Crezyman has risen up in conjunction with the fanatical religious sect of Garfists to obtain the throne of Bardonia for the former Chancellor’s appointed heir and son, Eleven.\n\nIt is currently unknown how much strength Eleven’s monarcho-communist revolution has amassed, but the cities of the west have stopped responding to Bardonian orders, and soldiers, and officers alike are more and more prone to desert their posts. For all intents and purposes, the west has severed itself off of Bardonia, Crezyman and Eleven have vowed to fight the Empire until the end."
 bardonia.1.a:0 "And fight them we shall."
 bardonia.2.t:0 "Intelligence Report: Andorn"
 bardonia.2.d:0 "Andorn was a vassal of Bardonia since the collapse of the Second Tsardom of Ryzan, where local officials were able to wrest control of the territory and side with the Bardonian Empire against Ryzan. Since then, the territory has remained relatively depopulated, whether one likes it or not, it simply is no easy task to convince settlers to migrate into the frigid woodlands of northern Syltor. As a result of Andorn’s depopulation, most communities have developed on the coasts, with these coastal states claiming massive swaths of territory stretching into the Syltorean forests.\n\nUnder the chancellorship of Uni, however, things did change. Uni was able to carve vassal states out of the previously depopulated coastal regions of Andorn, the prominent ones being: Savras, Wivamovia, Bizesonne, and the Heli Kingdom, out of these four, Savras came to dominate the region, boasting a strong central metropolis with several suburbs, and a higher population than the other four states.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Bardonian authority across Andorn, the state of Savras has jumped to declare itself the successor of the Bardonian occupation of Andorn, claiming all of Andorn for itself with the exception of Wivamovia and Heli, and styling itself the “Holy Syltor Empire”. The former Bardonian Emperor, Jacw, both recognized and allied with this political entity, which puts us in a difficult situation. If we denounce this alliance we risk both our own diplomatic reputation, and even losing Andorn to Ryzani forces, if we keep it, we run the risk of not being able to integrate Andorn at all. Time will tell which decision ends up being best for us."
 bardonia.2.a:0 "We have a choice to make."
 bardonia.3.t:0 "Bardonia offers aid"
 bardonia.3.d:0 "Ice, the Bardonian diplomat, has arrived in Savras to negotiate aid from Bardonia to the Holy Syltor Empire. Representing the HSE, our diplomat Ian was able to negotiate a deal wherein in exchange for Bardonian industries involving themselves with the urbanization of Northern Andorn, the HSE would agree to cooperate more closely with Bardonia in most circumstances. Ian responded positively towards the deal, but refused to offer a conclusion on whether this advance would be accepted, leaving it to Hernicii to decide. \n\nThis agreement could move to secure our alliance with Bardonia, but some councilmembers worry that accepting such a deal could be flying too close to sun, hastening our re-entry into Bardonia. Ultimately our choice depends on how far we are willing to go to preserve the Holy Syltor Empire, and how much we trust Bardonia to respect our independence. Upon receiving news of this potential deal, Hernicii remarked-"
 bardonia.3.a:0 "Better the devil you know."
 bardonia.3.b:0 "Do they really think we’ll trust them?"
 bardonia.4.t:0 "A Land Invasion"
 bardonia.4.d:0 "The only path to Andorn reintegration is by force, whether one likes it or not, Andorn is simply too stubborn to accept bardonian suzerainty again. Therefore, it must be put to head the skewering of Andorn. The current plan is for Bardonian marines to flank southwards and brave into the marshes of Savras, and for subsequent troops to invade by sea into Orilin, effectively decapitating the Andorn state by eliminating their main sources of power. \n\nIn preparation for this swift maneuver, the remnants of the Bardonian army have begun exercises, simulating the trudging invasion of the Savras Swamps, and the siege of their outer walls. Though these exercises were quite specialized,  they provided valuable experience to the new conscripts of the Bardonian army, with most senior soldiers having left the army or otherwise died after the ferrymen war."
 bardonia.4.a:0 "The plan is approved"
 bardonia.5.t:0 "An Offer from Bardonia"
 bardonia.5.d:0 "Bardonia has long been our friend, even before Uni’s coronation. Though in recent times that has begun to fade, especially after the fall of Bardonian forces against the ferryman, and the coronation of the new emperor Mobius. But now, to the shock of the people, comes emperor Mobius himself, accompanied only by his chief diplomat, with nothing but a slip of paper and a smile on his face. Rumor has it that he is here to extend an olive branch from Bardonia once again and shine a new light on our old friendship."
 bardonia.5.a:0 "We will join this new alliance"
 bardonia.5.b:0 "Maybe later…"
 bardonia.6.t:0 "Niedia Accepts"
 bardonia.6.d:0 "Our diplomatic delegation the Empire of Niedia has been successful. We were able to sway Herod and negotiate a new alliance between our states. Needless to say, this will have far-reaching geopolitical consequences but will be much to the boon of the Bardonian state and that of Niedia. Though the fruits of our friendship are yet to bear, there is nothing but hope for the future."
 bardonia.6.a:0 "Wonderful"
 bardonia.7.t:0 "Niedia Denies"
 bardonia.7.d:0 "Despite our attempt at overture to the Solleanean Empire of Niedia, we have been turned down. Niedia offered no disclosure for their reason to deny our advances, but has provided a concise statement of intention that they are “Not looking to ally with the Bardonian Empire”. Unfortunately, we have been unable to sway Herod and will need to stand on the world stage without them. "
 bardonia.7.a:0 "Unfortunate"
 bardonia.8.t:0 "An Offer from Bardonia"
 bardonia.8.d:0 "Bardonia has long been our friend, even before Uni’s coronation.

 bardonia.8.a:0 "A Worthy Initiative"
 bardonia.8.b:0 "Who needs the Bardonians?"
 bardonia.9.t:0 "Huitca says Yes"
 bardonia.9.d:0 "Our old friend to the South has accepted our renewed hand in friendship! The Emperor’s attempts to sway the favor of the nation of the Huitca Federation has gone swimmingly, and the Huitcans have shown their overwhelming support of our joint alliance. Seeing this, the Cihuacoatl has gladly signed the agreement brought in by Mobius. After this, a new chapter can unfold for our continued relations with our friends."
 bardonia.9.a:0 "Cheers!"
 bardonia.10.t:0 "Huitca says no"
 bardonia.10.d:0 "In a diplomatic spit at the foot to our emperor and our diplomatic integrity, the corrupt politicians of Huitca have thoroughly rejected our offer of an alliance, and by doing this they have clamped down on our diplomatic ambitions across the Syltor continent, and in doing so have squandered any of their chances of further cooperation! Should they dare insult us like this again, we won’t take it as easily..."
 bardonia.10.a:0 "Dammit!"
 bardonia.11.t:0 "The Foundation of the Allium Alliance"
 bardonia.11.d:0 "It was a particularly windy day in New Dorasterrock when the pact was first announced: “Attention all who reside in Rathnir, on this day, I do announce the Allium Alliance, a new alliance on the world stage designed to protect Bardonia and it’ allies’ interests..” Chancellor Mobius declared, trying to pierce the wind with his voice. Mobius stood on the steps of the New Dorasterrock palace speaking to a global crowd, which was not an uncommon occurrence due to the sheer amount of reforms needed to be announced in this turbulent period. This announced pact was to be dubbed the “Allium Alliance '', and in Mobius’s mind, was designed to safeguard the Bardonian homeland from any potential foreigner marauders and help facilitate global cooperation. Though it was met with initial internal skepticism, the grand council eventually came to accept the deal as beneficial. \n\nAs Mobius wrapped up his monthly speeches to the nation, he was offered immediate reassurance by the thunderous applause by not just New Dorasterrock citizens, but also of the international delegates in New Dorasterrock. Regardless of any previous doubts of the alliance working out, the delegates of the Allium member-states came home that day reassured of its security."
 bardonia.11.a:0 "Whatever the weather, we stick together!"
 bardonia.12.t:0 "The Allium Alliance"
 bardonia.12.d:0 "Just recently in the Bardonian capital of New Dorasterrock, Chancellor Mobius has declared the creation of a new alliance designed to safeguard the interests of it's members. Dubbed the “Allium Alliance” it seeks to use the analogy of an Onion’s layers to represent itself. It’s members consist of Huitca, Niedia, and Bardonia, who have all released joint statements declaring their intention to join into the alliance.\n\nWith this, international observers question the reaction of other nations, and the possibility of a conflict starting between this bloc and other nearby organizations. It is currently unknown what the next move of the Allium Alliance will be, but some say that this bloc could enter into a war with the nearby KATO alliance."

 bardonia.15.t:0 "The Failure of the Allium Alliance"
 bardonia.15.d:0 "Recently Bardonia has announced its intentions to create a grand alliance to safeguard the north of Rathnir from the south. This was seen as a noble initiative by many other northerners, who were expected to show up to the congress for the creation of the Allium Alliance, but there was just one problem, nobody accepted the invites. \n\nThis is utterly humiliating for Bardonia, as it’s diplomatic position has been weakened significantly, with many southerners calling for war with Bardonia just for the idea of trying to make a northern union. Meanwhile in New Dorasterrock, Bardonian diplomats are rapidly trying to secure alliances with smaller states in an attempt to recuperate their loss of prestige."
 bardonia.15.a:0 "Bardonia sinks lower"
 bardonia.16.t:0 "War with Bardonia"
 bardonia.16.d:0 "The Bardonians seem to have collapsed and continue to collapse as time goes on. Therefore it is not too much of a stretch to say that we could easily defeat them in a war for the entire northern fish. Seeing these circumstances, our great leader has taken it upon themselves to declare a new war with Bardonia, to liberate the Northern Fish!"
 bardonia.16.a:0 "And so we go"
 bardonia.17.t:0 "Valle declares War"
 bardonia.17.d:0 "Just recently the king of Valle, Harvbarr, has issued a declaration to the Bardonian Empire, citing “The Liberation of the Northern Fish” as his casus belli. This is greatly dishonorable, declaring war on a collapsing nation, so we will need to take it upon ourselves to teach these vultures some respect."
 bardonia.17.a:0 "To war!"
 bardonia.18.t:0 "The King in Baykonia"
 bardonia.18.d:0 "The present king of Baykonia, our easternmost frontier, has become quite rebellious, he has made moves to secure his kingdom’s autonomy from the government of Bardonia, and it has begun to worry many among the higher echelons of the government that Baykonia may attempt to revolt if given enough time, as he has done everything in his power to support to liberation of Baykonia.\nThey are holding elections soon, it would be a shame if they were to be canceled and the king removed from power."
 bardonia.18.a:0 "He must be deposed"
 bardonia.18.b:0 "We can’t risk losing the support of Baykonia"
 bardonia.19.t:0 "The Fate of Bizesonne"
 bardonia.19.d:0 "Bizesonne is a small breakaway state from what used to be the Kingdom of Andorn. We have recognized it and have moved not to aggress against it without cause. However, it is still well within our sphere of influence, we could potentially try to subjugate it and expand our territory, though this could anger the Aurlunoren, or we could guarantee it as to bring it even closer into the Bardonian sphere of Influence."
 bardonia.19.a:0 "We will Guarantee this Kingdom"
 bardonia.19.b:0 "They must integrate join into Bardonian Andorn"
 bardonia.20.t:0 "Bardonia demands Subjugation"
 bardonia.20.d:0 "Bardonia has demanded that we join into their greater empire! Most people say that it would be wise given our small army and lack of defenses, but some say that our state should resist until the end. But for many the question still hangs in the air, why are you playing Bizesonne?"
 bardonia.20.a:0 "Ay carumba we surrender!"
 bardonia.20.b:0 "Bizesonne can't surrender!"
 bardonia.21.t:0 "Bizesonne refuses our demands"
 bardonia.21.d:0 "Bizesonne has refused entry into Bardonia, stating that as a sovereign state, they have the right to maintain their national borders. Further, they have denounced this act of imperialism as being brutish and uncouth. Truly the Bardonian army fears the might of Bizesonne, but we must still fight them to further the interests of Bardonia, and to not go back on our ultimatum."
 bardonia.21.a:0 "We go to war"
 bardonia.22.t:0 "A New High Command"
 bardonia.22.d:0 "After the Ferrymen war, the majority of Bardonia’s high command either fled the nation or died. As such, Mobius, previously not thought a serious candidate for the rulership of the nation, has ascended as its sovereign. This theme can be seen all throughout the nation, with many local administrations adopting new leadership in order to repair the hole left by the departure of the old guard. This must happen on a larger scale, the newly-crowned emperor to set his sights on seeking out a new command for the reborn Bardonian high government. These Jobs being much craved and sought after by many throughout the nation, it would not be hard to find people willing to take these jobs. Though finding qualified officials is much easier said than done. "
 bardonia.22.a:0 "New officials must be chosen"
 bardonia.23.t:0 "Ultimatum from Bardonia"
 bardonia.23.d:0 "Bardonian ships have pulled into the waters of the Wivamovian coast, and as the people watched from the beaches and boardwalks, a smaller ship glided up forwards to the ports with 2 passengers. Bardonian Emperor Mobius and his Chief Diplomat Ice. As they parted, the crowd saw many isolated words on the document being held by the Emperor. ‘Demands’ ‘sovereign’ ‘invasion’ are some of the many that stood out. As the pair made their way to the capitol, whispers spread among the crowd and the boats inched closer. Inside the capitol, or more accurately Indominus’s office, Mobius firmly placed the paper on the king’s desk and handed him a pen. The paper had a bold and clear heading. One word. Ultimatum. Mobius let out a grunt and sat down as Ice closed the door. Reading through the paper, the king soon realized that this ultimatum would, as people feared, make Wivamovia a Bardonian client-state, and it doesn’t seem like the Emperor’s going to leave until he has a definitive answer."
 bardonia.23.a:0 "This attempt at imperialism is worthy only of ridicule."
 bardonia.23.b:0 "We cannot win this..."
 bardonia.24.t:0 "Wivamovia denied."
 bardonia.24.d:0 "Wivamovia has somehow mustered the courage to deny our ultimatum. The reasoning behind this is likely to have been pure stubbornness or perhaps foolishness. The nation of Wivamovia is diplomatically isolated and has little in terms of military capacity or alliances. Our soldiers will not have a difficult time enforcing our claims in the Wivamonties "
 bardonia.24.a:0 "To War!"
 bardonia.25.t:0 "Wivamovia accepts"
 bardonia.25.d:0 "Wivamovia, the state with little to no standing army present, has been practically forced to enter into our union. Bardonian troops have been quick to enter the Wivamovian cities, denying any potential seizure of territory by Ryzan. Our diplomatic position in Andorn has been strengthened significantly, seeing as we now control one of the main competitors for power in Andorn."
 bardonia.25.a:0 "Always was Bardonian."
 bardonia.26.t:0 "Wivamovia denied."
 bardonia.26.d:0 "Wivamovia has refused our ultimatum, citing their continued alliance with Ryzan. Unfortunately, they do have us on this one. Our army is not in any condition to fight Ryzan and KATO at the moment, it is a diplomatic failure on our part to allow Wivamovia to last long enough to formalize entry into this alliance. Until we have built our strength enough, we will be unable to integrate Wivamovia into our nation, seeing as they are under foreign protection."
 bardonia.26.a:0 "We bide our time."
 bardonia.27.t:0 "The HSE accepts aid."
 bardonia.27.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Holy Syltor Empire has accepted our aid. This did not come as a suprise due to the poor economic conditions of Andorn, being in a sparsely populated and desolate state, our relatively meager offering of funds, was enough to significantly boost the dismal economy of Andorn, making it quite the wise decision to accept our offer. Due to this aid we have sent, the Andornans are now in our debt, and we have advanced in the race for Andorn."
 bardonia.27.a:0 "A small price to pay."
 bardonia.28.t:0 "The HSE refuses aid."
 bardonia.28.d:0 "Suprisingly, the Holy Syltor Empire has refused our aid. Whether it be to a reluctance to accept Bardonian influence, or possible aid, our offers have been unfortunately declined, negating any influence we could have possibly gained by them accepting our deal."
 bardonia.28.a:0 "Unfortunate"
 bardonia.29.t:0 "Bardonia sends additional aid."
 bardonia.29.d:0 "Bardonia has sent us more aid in the form of material support for our cause of uniting Andorn. Given as we have accepted their previous support, we are in no position to reject this further aid. New shops have also been built in Savras under facilitation by the Bardonian Government."
 bardonia.29.a:0 "Great."
 bardonia.30.t:0 "Bardonia’s space in Eldham?"
 bardonia.30.d:0 "The recently discovered ‘new world’ of Eldham has spun the leaders of Rathnir into a daze, including that of our own emperor. While the value of the land is high without a doubt, there is also quite a risk in setting up any Bardonian holdings. The cost is relatively high, there are already friends and foes in the lands sought, and tensions already run high among the nations already established. Though a suggestion has popped up within the court, a compromise. Specifically, this compromise would establish a company directly controlled by Bardonia that would control land in Eldham, though largely acts independent, an Eldham Trade Company. While this may work, it could be going too far and angering potential allies, or it could be coming up short, leaving wasted room for further expansion."
 bardonia.30.a:0 "The Trade Company is a grand idea!"
 bardonia.30.b:0 "No. Eldham is too risky."
 bardonia.31.t:0 "Success in Eldham"
 bardonia.31.d:0 "Our attempt at an Eldham Colony has been successful. Our settlers were able to land in Northern Serrona, and quickly spread to create increasingly larger networks of settlements, our colony “Dandelonia” has now become self-sustaining, sending boatloads of gold back to Bardonia. Though our colony does continue to face resistance from the Lo’oix natives, this resistance has been brutally put down by colonial militias."
 bardonia.31.a:0 "Dandelonia rises.  "
 bardonia.32.t:0 "Failure in Eldham"
 bardonia.32.d:0 "Our attempt at an Eldham Colony was short-lived and unsuccessful, we first started by attempting to land ships full of soldiers and settlers in Northern Phoros. While our settlement was initially successful, our settlers were repeatedly harassed by pirate raids! These pirate infested waters deterred many Bardonians from trying to settle in Eldham, and our colonies fizzled out, costing us much money in the process."
 bardonia.32.a:0 "Bloody land!"
 bardonia.33.t:0 "Ultimatum from Bardonia"
 bardonia.33.d:0 "The Bardonian Embassy in Halge has recently sent us an ultimatum for the immediate capitulation of the Halgean state to Bardonia, and it’s total integration into the greater Bardonian nation. This would of course mean the end of our independent government, and would be a great defeat for our people, though the Bardonian military is significantly more developed than ours, and surrender could mean prevention of unnecessary death and destruction. "
 bardonia.33.a:0 "We surrender!"
 bardonia.33.b:0 "Halge is not yet lost!"
 bardonia.34.t:0 "Halge Surrenders"
 bardonia.34.d:0 "Halge has submitted to our will and has announced the integration of the state of Halge into the Bardonian Empire. This new influx of soldiers and industry from Halge will bolster our state to a position where we can soon demand Lennox itself!"
 bardonia.34.a:0 "We will prevail."
 bardonia.35.t:0 "Halge resists!"
 bardonia.35.d:0 "Halge has refused to integrate into the Bardonian Empire. They have asserted their right as an independent nation to be free from foreign influence. We could back this insubordination with swift military action, though some think it may not be wise to attempt to land in Halge. Our navy is likely in a position to facilitate such a landing at Halge, but most worries are from the fact that KATO may try to get involved."
 bardonia.35.a:0 "Another state to crush"
 bardonia.35.b:0 "Lets not be so rash to start a conflict..."
 bardonia.36.t:0 "Bardonia backs down"
 bardonia.36.d:0 "Bardonia, a nation of cowards and clowns, has backed down from their previous demands, stating that they were not willing to bring war to Syltor. This is humiliating for Bardonia and is yet another example of the basedness and chadness of the Halgean Nation. In celebration of this diplomatic victory, the Halgean army has begun to parade down the avenues of the capital, to much local fanfare and relief."
 bardonia.36.a:0 "We have prevailed!"
 bardonia.37.t:0 "Bizesonne accepts our demands"
 bardonia.37.d:0 "Bizesonne has unsurprisingly surrendered to us. The core Bizesonne territories are now within our control and their previous leader has been deposed. The Bizesonne administration has been merged into Andorn as Richteria."
 bardonia.37.a:0 "Ok."
 bardonia.38.t:0 "Ultimatum from Bardonia"
 bardonia.38.d:0 "We have been cursed! Cursed by the arrival of Bardonian diplomats that is. Wandering into our capital, Dragoonios, and escorted by armed Dandelion Guards, the arriving delegates presented the audacity to demand the full surrender of our state and integration into the Bardonian Empire. These demands are of course outrageous, and we would look pitifully weak on the world stage if we were to accept this. Thinking quickly, our king make a quick decision and decided the best course of action would be to…"
 bardonia.38.a:0 "We must surrender"
 bardonia.38.b:0 "Imprison the Delegates"
 bardonia.39.t:0 "The Lennox Surrender"
 bardonia.39.d:0 "Lennox, the last remaining bastion of power on the Northern Fish, has fallen to our power. We now control nearly all significant population centers on the Island, and with this, the population of our empire has increased by nearly a quarter. The industry of the Northern Fish is also ours to exploit as well, being significant in urban areas such as Luperkania. \n\nRyzan is also now prevented from gaining a potential ally from which to flank us with. Needless to say, now that the penultimate domino of Syltor has fallen, Ryzan is well within striking distance, much more than they might like to be. "
 bardonia.39.a:0 "One by one, the pieces fall into place."
 bardonia.40.t:0 "The Dragoonian Emergency"
 bardonia.40.d:0 "The ultimatum to Lennox has resulted in a retaliation quite unexpected. Upon entering Dragoonios armed and demanding the capitulation of the Lennox State, our delegates and their armed escorts soon found themselves being detained. Our guards were overwhelmed and defeated during the fighting. While the delegates were unharmed, they had been captured by the government of Lennox in a stunning moment of resistance to Bardonian demands. \n\nThis move has sent shockwaves through the international community, with some criticizing Lennox for breaching international etiquette by capturing delegates, and others appraising them for withstanding “Bardonia Oppression”. Due to this international reaction, we must act carefully as not to destroy our reputation among the international community any more than it has been already."
 bardonia.40.a:0 "This Means War!"
 bardonia.41.t:0 "Addressing our Economic Issues"
 bardonia.41.d:0 "Our economy is in a state of utter disarray after the Bardonian Collapse. Though we were unable to initially amend it, our prior reforms have allowed us the breathing room to finally make a choice on the evolution of the Bardonian economy. While this matter was debated in the great halls of New Dorasterrock, two different factions emerged. One faction, the “Militarists”, advocate for the expansion of Bardonia’s military-industrial capacity. The primary focus of this expansion would be into the Northern Regions of Bardonia bordering Auron’s peak, with the complexes eventually becoming a seamless part of the greater Auronian industries. The second faction, known as the ”Industrialists”, advocate for an expansion of the civilian industries of Bardonia, seeking to create a powerful economy for Bardonia to gain diplomatic leverage with. \n\nUltimately the choice of our economic model is purely up to Mobius, which model is chosen will affect our ability to survive as a nation, and to defend ourselves from exterior threats."
 bardonia.41.a:0 "We must decide our Economic Direction"
 bardonia.42.t:0 "Uni Returns"
 bardonia.42.d:0 "Uni found himself conscious again as he had finally separated from the body of the Chancellor and into a spirit-like form. It was here, outside out of the mortal realm, outside the bounds of human reality, the spirit of Uni lay dormant. Cognizant of nothing, free of desire, the spirit felt as if eons passed had passed in the nothingness. Though this was soon to change \n\nSeveral Bardonian officials draped in green robes descended down the craggy steps of the Dorasterrock Crypt, with only candlelight to illuminate the decrepit stone pathways which writhed their ways into the lower levels of the mausoleum. They walked among the dead, their names being inscribed into their sarcophaguses. Eventually, after some time checking each and every label, they came to a large, bronze, plaque stating “UNI”. They had found what they were looking for. \n\nThe group stood back as the sorcerer among them cast some bygone spell. Sparks and lightning came to consume the crypts as the magic undertook its orders. In conjunction, the sorcerer brought forth the sword that slew the fallen chancellor. Lightning began to orbit the sword, causing it to become volatile, with sparks and flares of lightning spitting in every direction. This crescendo decimated the crypt, but the climax even more so. The dark magic caused a large explosion within the coffin, which came to be torn asunder. \n\nAs the smoke cleared, the sorcerer was nowhere to be seen, the robed finding themselves brutally affected by the explosion, suffering severe burns, though this was not their primary focus. As the smoke cleared, a figure could be seen rising from the smoke, laughing as he did so. Recognized immediately to be Uni’s laugh, from a figure that could not be mistaken, the Prophet of Bardonia."
 bardonia.42.a:0 "The Chancellor has returned."
 bardonia.43.t:0 "Bardonia Beckons"
 bardonia.43.d:0 "For a substantial amount of time, we have been close partners with the empire of Bardonia, to the point that we became a client state under their protection. Though earlier today, we were sent a… request from Chancellor Uni. Specifically, the chancellor calls upon us to return to the greater whole of the Bardonian empire."
 bardonia.43.a:0 "And so we go"
 bardonia.43.b:0 "This must be an imposter, surely."
 bardonia.44.t:0 "A Denial of Annexation"
 bardonia.44.d:0 "Surprisingly, Auron’s peak has resisted our calls for integration. This is quite bizarre, as it was fully expected that they would reintegrate upon the arrival of the Chancellor, needless to say, he has, though quite baffled, come up with only one solution."
 bardonia.44.a:0 "It’s war then."
 bardonia.45.t:0 "Auron Submits"
 bardonia.45.d:0 "The state of Auron’s peak was quick to respond to our beckoning, DHVO has signed an agreement  agreeing for Auron’s peak to reintegrate into the Bardonian Empire as an autonomous state. Our military industry has now been strengthened significantly by this access to the Auronian factories, kickstarting our military production into high orbit. "
 bardonia.45.a:0 "At last, Bardonia is reunified."
 bardonia.46.t:0 "The Dandelist Utopia"
 bardonia.46.d:0 "We have successfully rid the Bardonian nation of most if not all of its primary flaws. Instability has become a thing of the past, and the Bardonian army has risen once more into it’s status of being a respectable institution. Our diplomatic position has been utterly secured, as we have several loyal allies to help protect our lands. The prophet has returned to return spirituality to the Bardonian nation, creating a population of fierce patriots. Nothing short of a global coalition could end what is soon to become the Bardonian century. "
 bardonia.46.a:0 "And so it begins."
 bardonia.47.t:0 "The Ryzan War"
 bardonia.47.d:0 "The eternal thorn in our side, the Ryzanis. Every move we make, they check, every step we take, they get in the way. They have positioned themselves as our rival, and if it’s that they seek, then it’s that which they shall get. Conferences have been held repeatedly among the Allium Alliance seeking a solution to our troubles with Ryzan. Among those thrown about the most, is the prospect of war. \n\nUni has accepted this proposal. Starting immediately upon the signing of the declaration of war, Bardonian soldiers will begin their march into Ryzan from both sides, capturing Carthya and Volkoregrod in quick succession, putting a fiery end to the antagonistic liberal institution residing on our border, and connecting the two halves of our nation. \n\nUndoubtedly excited for the prospect of a real war, this move has been applauded by the Bardonian Military, though the reaction of the international community has yet to be gauged. "
 bardonia.47.a:0 "The March to Carthya begins"
 bardonia.48.t:0 "Bardonian Invasion of Ryzan"
 bardonia.48.d:0 "The self-proclaimed Bardonian prophet, Uni, has released an announcement this morning declaring war on the Republic of Ryzan. Citing the constant anti-Bardonian stance and statements of the present Ryzani government, Uni has vowed to enforce a “Stabilized Government” over the lands of Ryzan. \n\nThe Ryzani government and its allies have reacted with disgust at this proclamation, decrying the actions of the Bardonian government as imperialistic and bandit-like. Regardless of the world’s protests, the Bardonian military has begun a military operation in Ryzan, and is already likely en-route to important Ryzani targets such as Volkoregrod and Carthya. It will be up to Ryzan to stop the Bardonian invasion."
 bardonia.48.a:0 "Syltor in flames"
 bardonia.49.t:0 "Mesa for sale?"
 bardonia.49.d:0 "Bardonia has requested a share of our land in use for gold mining. They have promised to pay us a massive sum of money for this territory. We gain massive profits from controlling this land already, but it is debated whether this sum of money will offer us more than the mines will ever produce."
 bardonia.49.a:0 "Accepted."
 bardonia.49.b:0 "Who do they think they are?"
 bardonia.50.t:0 "Mesa for sale!"
 bardonia.50.d:0 "The Mafia has accepted our deal. Effective immediately, Mafia agents have escorted from the territory to introduce Bardonian occupation. Bardonian laborers have flocked overseas to mine into the new territories, hoping to try their luck for gold. Many have described this as a new gold rush, with many Bardonians moving southwards. "
 bardonia.50.a:0 "To the Mesa!"
 bardonia.51.t:0 "Not for Sale."
 bardonia.51.d:0 "Unfortunately, our scheme to make massive amounts of money for Bardonia has failed. The Sewor Mafia has denied our request to purchase the Mesa. They have decided that the benefits of keeping the mesa far outweighed the benefits of the lump sum Bardonia had to offer. Though this scheme has failed, there will always be more value in the world to seize, this was not our last resort."
 bardonia.51.a:0 "Oh Well"
 bardonia.52.t:0 "The Bardonian Navy"
 bardonia.52.d:0 "The Bardonian military has long been feared for its reputation across the lands of Rathnir, with one notable exception, the navy. The truth is, navies are difficult to maintain and build, and Bardonia has never particularly needed one, though that has changed in recent times. A naval landing would have made the Ryzan War easier, as well as provide us significant diplomatic power on the world stage, being able to reach so far as even Viodoxa. \n\nThere are several candidates for the position of a naval high command, many of them serving as Bardonian Army officers before the Navy was even formalized, though some were not in the armed forces previously, they may have accrued experience navigating fishing vessels, or even working as pirates in the south. We are typically strict on our recruitment process, so only a few of these candidates have been accepted"
 bardonia.52.a:0 "Bardonia needs a navy."
